# 0chan.hk Code of Conduct

Be pathient, as patience may help you better understand situation and thus avoid putting yourself to shame.
 
 **Be welcoming:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all ideologies and world-views. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability, as well as any kinds of racists, chauvinists, sexists and people with different kinds of mental diseases. So, don't try to enforce any form of censorship on anyone. If you don't like someone's statement, you can always argure with them or just pass by.
 
 **We believe**, that **conflicts are inevitable** in any society and any attempt to silence someone brings to the life yet another conflict. We also believe, that anything that is meant to be unacceptable in general can be natural and correct under some specific circumstances. So, **there is no way to define a strict set of restrictions, which will be in any way universal.** 
 
 However, **be careful** in the words that you choose: Anything you write here may start yet another stream of nonsensual garbage posts, which eventually will be deleted as any garbage is supposed to be. While writting, **keep in mind**, for **what purposes** are you doing that and to **what consequences** your words may lead.
